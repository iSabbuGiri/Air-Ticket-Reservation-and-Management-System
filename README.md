# Air-Ticket-Reservation-and-Management-System

# Overview

In this project, an Air Ticket Reservation and Management System has been developed using command-line applications. The system has two applications, one for staff 
members and the other for customers. The staff application allows staff members to search for flights, create and edit reservations, and manage customer profiles. 
The customer application allows customers to search for flights and check seat availability.
